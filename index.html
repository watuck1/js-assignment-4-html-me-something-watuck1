            <p>I haven't travelled much in my life. The places I've been were mostly local or I've been there on business without the opportunity to really visit and see the area. 
               But on one business trip I decided to do things different. I didn't do the usual fly in, take care of business, and fly home. This time I had a plan.</p>
             <p>I was scheduled to be in Las Vegas for three days at a conference. When the conference was over my wife would join me and we would stay in the area for a few days. We never seem to get away, so this would be a nice change. 
                At the end of the conference I checked out of my room and into a suite. I picked up my wife at the airport and let the fun begin. There is never a dull moment in Las Vegas. There are plenty of places to go to eat and for entertainment. 
               Vegas is know for it's nightlife and it can be pretty wild there once the sun goes down. Needless to say we had a good time in Las Vegas. But that wasn't the best part of the trip to me.</p>

            <p>While in Las Vegas we took a day trip to the Grand Canyon. Neither of us had been before and we wanted to visit since we were so close. It was worth the trip. I'm not a nature enthusiast or a lover of the great outdoors, but I would encourage anyone who has an opprtunity to travel to the Grand Canyon to make the trip. The sights were breathtaking. I mean they actually took your breath away. I have never seen a more beautiful sight in person than the Grand Canyon! </p>
